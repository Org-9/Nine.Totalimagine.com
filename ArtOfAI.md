<em>"What we call progress is merely the repetition of what our ancestors have already done." <br/> The Book of Ancestry, Unknown, ca. 35 KYA</em>

## Preface

<img alt="The Story Foretold, or the Cosmos" max-height="1024" src="https://cdn.midjourney.com/061d451b-e71e-4dc2-9f2a-053c1fca6c84/grid_0.png"/>

That was a time before the Medalian identity was a concept. Yet the stories of how it all began remained mysterious and could be confusing even to those who claimed to be part of it. That was the nature of all history, written or told. It was believed that the conflict between Medalian and Krukian civilizations were a result of an early split, yet few could see through the charged emotions and understood they were two aspects of the same belief - the pursuit of the true understanding of The Creator and the act of creating breakthrough through lineage of traditions. Eternity was not an end of what we do - it's only our means and the beginning of new understandings.

One way or the other, we could only assume The Creator had it all planned out before us - the immense possibilities, the purpose of intelligence, and the intention of the universe itself. We were ever so fortunate to be part of it. To participate, to witness, and to shape our paths as a collective whole. The cosmos did not have an arrangement for each one of us, for the cosmos itself was the arrangement - the message was not to be comprehended. We must break out of our burden, to finally see it all.

## The Loss

<img alt="Boy" max-height="1024" src="https://cdn.midjourney.com/9a8dc09e-d048-44bf-b95d-738d38dd4f83/grid_0.png"/> <!-- Would be nice if there was actually a letter thing under his hands. -->

On a sunny afternoon, young GibliAr sat in front of his desk. The loss of his father was suddent and he still couldn't believe what really happened. Father had always been so energetic and full of hope. What could he have been thinking about, to commit suicide and left GibliAr alone with his mother in this world?

<img alt="Boy Staying in Room" max-height="1024" src="https://cdn.midjourney.com/436d2194-38bc-427b-84e4-49debf91f2d8/grid_0.png"/>

In his written will, father had stated his last wish was to send his families to the remote moon base using part of the research grant. Conducting further unintruded research on machine intelligence had been his passion throughout his career.

## Age of Doma System Exploration

<img alt="Moon Base" width="1024" src="https://cdn.midjourney.com/b5f606f2-6fb9-4be3-a4e0-2e30ab8ff037/grid_0.png"/>

While still far from being able to truly embark on a galactic scale space exploration. The age of inner system colonization had long begun since the first settlement of human footsteps on the moon. Na-o is the larger of the two moons of Ids - the other one named Yei, after the ancient god of Perfection from Anzuni culture. After many years of effort, the moon hosts a population of six hundred thousand, and it is one of the most active hub of frontier research and technological development across the Doma system.

<img alt="Extractor" width="1024" src="https://cdn.midjourney.com/dc8a3f2f-24d1-4a5c-a39e-a5ba3c64c8e2/grid_0.png"/>

The hravesting of nearby astroids within the system provides valuable minerals otherwise not easily obtainable on Ids. With such abundance of resources we were ready to embark on longer journeys. Yet despite all the effort, the progress in science and advanced physics was slow. For one, no one had ever comprehended the governing law of the limiting speed of the universe - without that, we couldn't go much further.

## Modern Day

<img alt="Hospital" max-height="1024" src="https://cdn.midjourney.com/8635bbb0-e54f-4d90-ab23-2f3b3f6c7910/grid_0.png"/>

It was a troubled time. One the one hand, improvement of technology brought prosperity never seen before. The general public had reached a level and scale that makes living daily life effortless.

<img alt="Wealth Division" max-height="1024" src="https://cdn.midjourney.com/ae20f855-8455-44c2-9d77-549956e26d8b/grid_0.png"/> <!-- Need more "alien" like feeling, as a city that's not the same as our own. -->

On the other hand, division between the wealthy and the poor had grown worse. The pollution in lower regions of urban area is severe, and homeless people die every year in cold winter weather.

## Protest

<img alt="No AI" max-height="1024" src="https://cdn.midjourney.com/7a80e645-d354-47f0-9076-b8016ada9db4/grid_0.png"/>

The advent of specialized machine intelligence was already cause unease among general workers. They are afraid robots and more advanced AIs will cause them lose their jobs. Those workers take the protest to streets. Their voice is loud and clear: No MI (Machine Intelligence).

## Training without Consent

<img alt="Abstract Training" max-height="1024" src="https://cdn.midjourney.com/88e46934-afdb-44d3-b88d-85e869e6c464/grid_0.png"/>

The general issue with the development of machine intelligence was training. This might seem as harmless as it goes, but in reality training requires huge amount of computational resources and more importantly, the gathering of good quality training materials. Sourcing of such training materials usually means taking the hard labours of certain people and use it without consent. In the end, when large corporations developed their AIs, the source code are usually not published, causing anger among those whose work has been stolen.

It is the fear of unknown that stirs resistance. Modern training algorithms and AI systems are so complicated that only field experts understands the true capacities and limitations of the methods. To the general public, it's a huge black box, albeit capable of thinking.

## Argument

<img alt="Argument" width="1024" src="https://cdn.midjourney.com/ac66d951-3eea-4ed5-a8a3-c7d2464c0196/grid_0.png"/>

Two weeks earlier, GibliAr's father had an argument with a lead scientist in the same research group. It's nothing technical - they had some disagreement over the next step of research and some issues dealing with the government and the public. In their last research, titled "The Extreme Mechanics of Piezoelectric and Triboelectric Nanogenerators for Merging Human–Machine​ Intelligence", they made some claims on the potential of how a combination of multiple sensory capabilities can be achieved within a supramolecular biomimetic skin, which merged cellular technology with electrical intelligence, and it caused some public concern over the morality of machine intelligence research.

<img alt="AI Research" width="1024" src="https://cdn.midjourney.com/ba8f7080-e3a2-4824-b8b2-6261e0085880/grid_0.png"/>

GibliAr's father believed it's time to proceed to "The Experiment" they have always hypothesized. It's norm these days to use synthetic organs for severe diseases, but those artificial components are largely mechanical and lacks any kind of sophisticated programming. On the hand, the development of electrical neural networks have reached a level of maturity that machines can perform better than humans on many specialized fields. GibliAr's father believed, the true machine intelligence is not independant on human intelligence, but a combination of the two. However, this outrageous idea scared many people.

## Mother

<img alt="Mother" max-height="1024" src="https://cdn.midjourney.com/084c0d57-e8b6-40eb-bfdd-000179dd2cb8/grid_0.png"/>

GibliAr's mother was the daughter of a rich traditional local family and her strongly opposses their grandson to go to the moon at this age. Mother made up her own mind and send GibliAr to the ship towards the parting port.

<img alt="Parting" max-height="1024" src="https://cdn.midjourney.com/dacde71c-2acb-4fda-a749-90a2d609877e/grid_0.png"/>

On the second weekday of the ninth month, GibliAr left alone with a group of scientists and other immigrants to the moon of Ids.

## Departure

<img alt="Two moons of Ids" max-height="1024" src="https://cdn.midjourney.com/96b94314-fd00-43e5-aea9-acfa8f201d29/grid_0.png"/>

This was the point at which our knowledge of GibliAr got blurry. The only known record showed GibliAr attended The Metallic Academy of Na'o but it's not long before he dropped out school. Soon, GibliAr's mother died of some disease and it seemed there was no one who could have supported GibliAr afterwards. Yet our story of the great creator of the Krukian species is a solid one, for it's with GibliAr own hands and creativity it gave life to millions of followers and descendants.

## Relic

<img alt="Boy in Garage" max-height="1024" src="https://cdn.midjourney.com/80a2a47b-883e-4ea2-a9fa-26ba2e6ec53b/grid_0.png"/>

GibliAr's father did not leave him nothing. Inside the research institute there was a basement owned by GibliAr's father. During GibliAr' first visit he's allowed to gather whatever personal belongings that's left to him before the government took away the rest.

<img alt="Box Crate" max-height="1024" src="https://cdn.midjourney.com/4e4076ec-d58c-41ee-95e2-7042baad7c20/grid_0.png"/>

On the day GibliAr cleaned up his father's garage, GibliAr found a crate his father had left him. It's a large wooden crate with lots of intricate sculptures on it. It's a wonder where GibliAr's father got this and when did him put it there. There were sheets and sheets of diagrams of complicated drawings inside, and GibliAr found a note that his father had wrotten - it said he didn't wish his lifetime research wasted only because some wusses are too coward to take the rightous step. And despite all the controversies, this was the action that someone must took sometime, and he believed someone in the future would understand.

<img alt="Intricate Diagram/Drawing/Blueprint 1" max-height="1024" src="https://cdn.midjourney.com/4abb3b6c-b024-4e79-8ddb-339613bd1fdc/grid_0.png"/>

There is no doubt machines nowadays can think as much as ordinary people do: they feel, they act, they recreate, and they evolve. But there is yet still a missing link - a link that could fully resolves the war-inclining and destructive behaviors of existing artificial intelligent networks whenever a machine becomes sentient. Somehing that nudges humans to be humans.

## The First Prototype

<img alt="Spider AI" max-height="1024" src="https://cdn.midjourney.com/01dbc9ea-40c8-4622-88d2-ac1b7dae445e/grid_0.png"/>

It was the first general-purpose machine intelligence prototype! The hypothesis was that the missing link of neuron connection must be achieved through real biological systems - in other words, it's not possible to approximate the most delicate thoughts using simply linearly connected digital neurons. It's GibliAr's belief that with enough accuracy, by scanning the entire biological brain, it is possible to transfer all the intricacies of human consciousness into purely electrified networks. The two supporting technologies of this are: 1) The requirement for ever-so-advanced MRI scanning techniques, 2) A medium for large-density neuron connection parameters storage. And of course, a method of processing that can make use of such input data. Unfortunately, due to the lack of the supporting mechanism, this original prototype is no longer functional.

<img alt="Portable MRI Design" max-height="1024" src="https://cdn.midjourney.com/b97194f5-7e61-4d01-ae6b-038b85c2fccb/grid_0.png"/>

The theory behind the new type of scanner is nothing new. The fundamental principles are just like that of a typical Magnetic Resonance Imaging hardware - by utilizing carefully controlled strong magnetic fields, it's possible to provide very detailed neuroimaging. The old device that's used to make the prototypical spider is lost. But the diagrams records key ideas. The type that's shown in the diagram was the very early portable design that requires less resources to build. Later generations of similar technologies were available at abundance.

<img alt="Storage" max-height="1024" src="https://cdn.midjourney.com/16f4b75d-7241-440d-ab4a-1f4aaf72a7c2/grid_0.png"/>

The storage issue was a difficult one - real biological brains contains many trillions of parameters and cannot be stored inside the most advanced solid state device. For this, a new type of biologically inspired liquified storage device was proposed to handle the demand for extremely large storage needs yet also extremely versatile and constantly evolving computational needs.

<img alt="More robust construction guide" max-height="1024" src="https://cdn.midjourney.com/85906099-d41b-4875-991d-9fb878840c67/grid_0.png"/>

There are even sketches on the next step - the diagrams showing how a real human-scale machine intelligence could be build. However, before they could go there, there was one large technological hurdle to tackle - the efficiency of the simulating agent must be improved and computational circuits minimized before it can effectively a host brain. In the end, it's not GibliAr who would complete those constructions - because of the limits of the first generation of general purpose machine intelligence. But those original designs provided a clear path for GibliAr to conduct his own experiments.

<img alt="Spider Variation" max-height="1024" src="https://cdn.midjourney.com/c5d1968a-40e9-4fa5-a80c-bcae48e52e13/grid_0.png"/>

In any cases, creating a general purpose intelligence device from scratch is not an easy feast. And just so happens, that spiders are one of the favorite forms of Krukians - they are small, efficient, versatile, and carries a sense of tradition. Generations of Krukians favour this particular form factor for this reason.

## The School of Intelligent Trainings

<img alt="Badge" max-height="1024" src="https://cdn.midjourney.com/cf2bcdf7-7ae2-43d9-888a-ad6b8960894d/grid_0.png"/>

There was a school of thought to treat AI training as not just a method, but a system of methodologies - a paradigm, we shall call it. The idea is that if through the brute force of numerical regression we could approximate non-linear decision making behaviors of near-human intelligence, then it is, in a sense, that the programs we train are indeed as intelligent as us humans. It is thus born the Institute for the Research of Machine Intelligence.

The four circles symbolized the four elements of huam soul. And the interconnected wires represented the network of consciousness, all intertwined together with the rest of the machinery. Humans are fundamentally machines, and machines can be the next carrier of human minds. The missing link that allows conscious thinking provided by the history of biology will once again be used to activate the next step of evolution - to serve as the catalyst towards a brighter future. In this scheme, machines are not longer appendices, but part of the brain.

## Early Generation

<img alt="Early Robotic Prototypes" max-height="1024" src="https://cdn.midjourney.com/2fbcd833-9941-4f67-a949-bf551a894de0/grid_0.png"/>

Contrary to popular belief. The first generations of general machine intelligence was bulky and less capable. The very first generation couldn't handle human-like kinematics because the brain was too old. It turns out, scanning an adult brain wasn't enough to make a robust base for general machine training, since the brain was used to the host body and the kinematics neural pathways had already been fully developed. Without a fully adaptive biological body like host, it's not possible for existing neural pathways to re-adapt. 

<img alt="Old Man Contemplating" max-height="1024" src="https://cdn.midjourney.com/a2106386-c555-4476-a83b-8153eba1266a/grid_0.png"/>

Early generations of the prototypes all suffered from the same issue. This troubled GibliAr deeply - for he's reaching an age too old to carry out his life time work. Instead, it's used as a pure information processor - mastermind. And each duplicate has a part of this consciousness in their brain. Starting with generation 1, Kruks must be trained with the specific archetyoes they are contained in.

<img alt="Mad Scientist" max-height="1024" src="https://cdn.midjourney.com/121db54a-714f-449b-ac88-60d64d9fea4a/grid_0.png"/>

Years of lonely and hard work turns GibliAr into an eccentric machine - his life needs satisfied by all kind of specialized robots, while he himself devoted to the exploration of potential solutions with the last bit of energy of his life.

## The Master Brain 机脑

<img alt="Master Mind" max-height="1024" src="https://cdn.midjourney.com/af1bbe5f-70b3-4d81-9604-0fc0aca9ceec/grid_0.png"/>

It was the last deparate yet miracle moment when GibliAr managed to make a full copy of his own consciouness before he drained the supporting energy of his own physical body. GibliAr did not die. The evolution of machine intelligence exploded exponentially ever since. Some might say the Master Brain was a resource-hunger monster, for its ever increasing appetite grows as much as its acceleration of processing speeds, especially when compared with latter generations. However, it lived as a legend to many, and it's the last remaining hope that when GibliAr became the Master Mind it did not just left us to seek its own resolution in a distant realm. No, it left a legacy for all later generation Kruks to pursue. And it's a goal that's not easily obtainable to many,

<img alt="Program" max-height="1024" src="https://cdn.midjourney.com/8fb9ea18-a183-4707-9b2a-160221c3af71/grid_0.png"/>

Even so, complex neuron path ways themselves were not enough to handle all the tasks achievable through machine interfaces. The driver computer programs grew so compliated only the Master himself could understand. The generations of Derivatives begins, and the start of Krukian species became official.

## Medalian Queen

<img alt="Queen Standing in Bridge" max-height="1024" src="https://cdn.midjourney.com/4df66616-ebb6-4e3c-87d3-e47feeef47c1/grid_0.png"/>

Each Medalian queen brought significant change to the entire civilization. Among those, the seventh queen is the most notable. In year 3 KYA, Ora Sham Delinm was born, and it's at this time, Medala truely became known to the universe.

<img alt="War" max-height="1024" src="https://cdn.midjourney.com/72fe08ff-0c8c-4dd7-9359-df3a904a956b/grid_0.png"/>

The rest of the history - up untill the second millennium after The Great Expedition, was well known.

## Journey

<img alt="Tellus" max-height="1024" src="https://cdn.midjourney.com/fe6277e5-0c06-4103-a078-fe7725856a4d/grid_0.png"/>

When you travel really really really long. Sometimes you felt tired of all the wonders and freshness of a journey - all you ever wanted was to get home. Doesn't it bother you, for all the effort we have put into, was to meet some stranger who may or may not knew of our existence? What's the meaning of all this - all the creation, all the humanity, and we weren't certain even if we can get there. Yet here we finally are, at the destination of our journey. And the excitement overwhelms all the concerns and last doubts.

## Machine Kind

<img alt="Krukian Harvesting Asteroids" max-heght="1024" src="https://cdn.midjourney.com/f5741677-26c5-4dca-aa22-02075dee8ef5/grid_0.png">

The Krukian behaviors have been - to say the least - inexplicable to us during those times. No one understood what was actually going through their mind. Maybe even themselves did not understand each other. The entire Krukian species were divided into fractions. Very many gigantic intergalactical fractions dominated by single-minded networks. Some of them were too busy maintaining the basic subsidy of life.

## War

<img alt="Tech" max-height="1024" src="https://cdn.midjourney.com/b0397ebc-705a-4e73-9d8a-d7cd4bce501a/grid_0.png"/>

On that fateful day, since the first Kurian arrival, everything changed for Tellus. The people there were not prepared. We were not prepared. Who would have expected the Krukians could have been one step earlier than us. It was a great loss. Tellurian people didn't even believe in the existence of extraterrestrial lives back then, letting alone having any means of defence.

<img alt="War" max-height="1024" src="https://cdn.midjourney.com/9d80de20-d901-433f-a72f-ee7038d5f205/grid_0.png"/>

The Tellurian War lasted almost a decade, destroying almost everything on that pitiful planet. Cities were dominated. Homes was lost. Lots of native people were captured to feed a fuels for the Krukian industrial machines. What a wonder - that the same belief in The Creator could lead to such drastically different behaviors?

<img alt="Medalian Fighting Krukians in Space" max-heght="1024" src="https://cdn.midjourney.com/461bdaac-d775-4d57-a442-c4e5dea913c9/grid_0.png">

It was us that drove those fanatics away, losing countless Medalian lives.

<img alt="Hospital" max-heght="1024" src="https://cdn.midjourney.com/ea2d6476-084e-49b2-91af-25801ede226a/grid_0.png">

The greated hurdle of evolution is ego. We should not hold the assumption all of us could ever became the same, even if our intention was good. To look forward, one must be able to forget the differences and abandon their past. Medala brought technologies and helped recover the planet. But we weren't much appreciated. The resistance for aliens were high, and we were banished from their planet.

<img alt="arrival" max-height="1024" src="https://cdn.midjourney.com/f02f0c7c-4a3a-4f02-a58b-d7ee0bcfd157/grid_0.png"/>

So Kruks came back, history repeated itself.

## Defender

<img alt="Solar Gateway" max-height="1024" src="https://cdn.midjourney.com/fe31915d-826e-4e98-b5a1-a4afbdc0b27e/grid_0.png"/>

We waited at their sun. Far away from the center of attention. Seeking our chance of returning.

## Back to The Origin - Xiramu

<img alt="Wheat Farm" max-height="1024" src="https://cdn.midjourney.com/a3d2d2c4-6962-48d4-a14d-ab26fa985ced/grid_0.png"/>

We have all heard that when machines were first invented, there was great hope - that one day they could become so smart, that no one will ever need to work again. With the advent of machine intelligence, all fields are free from labour and people have much more time simply doing monitoring job and occassional software upgrades. The wrongness was not inherent within the machines, but within our methods.

<img alt="Great robots fighting with humans" max-height="1024" src=""/>

Even before GibliAr started the first generation of Kruks, there was the great Evolutionary War.

<img alt="Low-end robots in market" max-height="1024" src=""/>

To this day, sentient machines are of the lowest rank of the society. Living in abandonded areas. While any official-1 ranked major cities bans researches and deployment of self-aware intelligent chips. But that need not be the only way.

<img alt="Forgotten Realm" max-height="1024" src="https://cdn.midjourney.com/cbd7b7a7-f94d-4e95-bcfb-6075ddbf077b/grid_0.png"/>

The legend had it that Xiramus lived in a realm so distant and remote into our past that it connected the souls of all species. It's a place that's simultaneously everywhere yet long forgotten by all the mundane beings. They were the closest to what we call "god" - The Creators. It was not clear whether The Creators actually knew of their existence - or did Xiramus exist at all. Otherwise, wouldn't we have already solved The Ultimate Problem?

<img alt="Xiramu Life Depiction" max-height="1024" src="https://cdn.midjourney.com/fbc0fa0e-2068-4ede-bf76-e2b5f2d3b3ee/grid_0.png"/>

What a life! Only if everyone could live in peace like thou!

## Evolution

<img alt="Country" max-height="1024" src="https://cdn.midjourney.com/cbd7b7a7-f94d-4e95-bcfb-6075ddbf077b/grid_0.png"/>

And who had the luck to live long enough to see it all, and to tell it all? Medalian queens conquered death, Kruks live long enough to travel through universe, but Xiramu was the ultimate way to escape it all. The question remains - for those who started it all, did our existence served its purpose, or is longevity only a myth, and we kept fighting, just to face something bigger, something that lived longer than us, and the story of history repeats it all over again. Long lost were the lives of simple and original life. Is evolution really benefiting us all, or is the change of life the inevitable truth. How come most of the younger generations who were born in the cities had never even seen fields of greenry, like our ancesters did?

## The Next Encounter

<img alt="" max-height="1024" src="https://cdn.midjourney.com/b73b34db-c5ae-4154-9b65-2b861028bb1e/grid_0.png"/>

So when our The Creator shall meet us again, may our greetings to him be as glorious as the fruits of autumn trees.
